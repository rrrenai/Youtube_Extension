# Flip You(tube) ?!
### The Youtube Extension which allows you to mirror your videos and loop specific segments!
Problem: There is no simple Youtube extension for mirroring/looping a segment of a video... so I made one!

How to install (this isn't on the Chrome store yet so you need to download):
1) Download all files from this repo
2) Go to __chrome://extensions__ and make sure Dev Mode is on
3) Click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner
4) Select the file folder
5) Test it on Youtube.com!

I'll try to polish it up in the future and get it on the Chrome store :)
Also Firefox is my primary browser and I want to port it to Mozilla too.
